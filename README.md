# Image-Search-Api-Project

Node search engine based on the Google Custom Search Engine that responds with a json object containing a url 
and other information on each result.
To search use the url below with /search/yourSearch where yourSearch is whatever images your looking for. 
Can request different result pages by adding ?page=1 which can be set to any positive integer. 
This project uses the Google Custom Search Engine through a node library called google-images. 
Can get search history at /history and recieve the history of searches in json formatting. 
Simple search history database made with mongoDB courtesy of mlab.

Made on glitch and so it is up and running over there ready to use: https://url-shortener-node.glitch.me/

This project was made for freecodecamp and for me to learn backend. It went pretty smooth and I
believe a big part of that was because of how simple it is to use the google-images library, big thanks to them for making it easy on me.

Can check out the image searching library here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-images
